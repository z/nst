Version: 0.98
Pre-Released: 01/26/09 (not yet officially released / not yet FINISHED)
Created By: Tyler "-z-" Mulligan of the Nexuiz Ninjaz (www.nexuizninjaz.com)

Required Software: screen
Optional Software: 'unzip' for package functions , 'qstat' for player numbers,
'svn' for nexuiz install, 'perl' for rcon2irc and rcon

Description:
This script was created to help admins manage many instances of servers by loading them
into seperate screens they can easily call by name.  For more information check --help.

Usage: nexst --(start_all|stop_all|restart_all|start <server>|stop <server>|restart <server>|list|view <server>|edit <server>|rcon2irc (start |stop|restart|view) <server>|create_maplist <gametype>|install_nst|uninstall_nst|install_nexuiz|pack_nst|help)

for more information, type: nexst --help

Special Thanks:
NST wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for the help and support of the following people:
MrBougo, Soulbringer, divVerent, mkzelda, Dokujisan, merlijn and the many others who have helped test NST.

This is the first bash script I've written longer than 10 lines.  While the language is a bit limiting at times, it's encouraged creative thinking and chanllenged me to think outside the box.  I'm very pleased with how far NST has gotten.  Going from a ~300 line screen manager to a full out extendable framework for Nexuiz game servers.
